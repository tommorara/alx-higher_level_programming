- Manage privileges for a user to a database or table
- Understand and use PRIMARY and FOREIGN keys
- Implement NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints
- Retrieve data from multiple tables in one request using various join techniques
- Utilize subqueries effectively
- Distinguish between JOIN and UNION operations

## Copyright and Plagiarism Policy

- Original solutions are required to achieve the learning objectives.
- Publishing project content is prohibited.
- Adherence to Holberton School's plagiarism policy is mandatory.

## Requirements

- Use of vi, vim, or emacs as text editors
- All files should end with a new line
- SQL queries must include a comment with a brief description of the query
- SQL keywords should be in uppercase
- A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory

## Setup and Installation

Instructions on installing MySQL 8.0 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and connecting to your MySQL server are included.

### Using 'container-on-demand' for MySQL

- Credentials: root/root
- Start MySQL with: `service mysql start`
- Import SQL dumps as needed for the project tasks.

## Tasks

Each task in this project is aimed at practicing a specific SQL technique or command. Ensure to follow the instructions for each task carefully and test your queries for correctness.

Good luck!
