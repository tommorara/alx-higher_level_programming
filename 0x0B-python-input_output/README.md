## Tasks
Each task in this project will help you to understand and implement Python I/O functionalities thoroughly. Make sure to adhere to the project guidelines and use the resources provided to tackle each task effectively.

### Guidelines
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5)
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` (version `2.7.*`)
- All your files must be executable
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_class").__doc__)'`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_function").__doc__)'`)
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

Feel free to reach out if you encounter any issues. Remember, Python programming is awesome, and so are you!
