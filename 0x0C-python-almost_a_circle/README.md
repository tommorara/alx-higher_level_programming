0x0C. Python - Almost a Circle
This project is a comprehensive review of Python, focusing on preparing students for the AirBnB project, a significant part of the Higher Level curriculum. It encompasses a wide array of Python programming concepts, including object-oriented programming (OOP), unit testing, serialization/deserialization, and file I/O operations, among others.

Background Context
The AirBnB project is a cornerstone of the advanced curriculum. This preparatory project is designed to solidify your understanding of Python, covering essential concepts such as import statements, exceptions, classes, private attributes, getter/setter methods, class and static methods, inheritance, unit testing, and file operations. Additionally, it introduces args and kwargs, serialization/deserialization, and JSON handling, equipping you with the skills needed for complex project development.

Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, you'll be able to:

Describe what unit testing is and how to implement it in large projects.
Explain how to serialize and deserialize a class.
Demonstrate how to write and read from a JSON file.
Use *args and **kwargs in function definitions.
Handle named arguments in functions.
Resources
To support your learning and project completion, consider reviewing the following resources:

args/kwargs
JSON encoder and decoder
unittest module
Python test cheatsheet
Requirements
Adherence to Python code style and conventions.
Implementation of unit testing for each module and function.
Proper use of serialization and deserialization for class instances.
Effective use of *args and **kwargs in function calls and definitions.
Completion of all tasks and challenges within the given timeframe.
