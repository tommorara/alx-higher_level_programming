# 0x0A. Python - Inheritance

This project is part of the curriculum of the Holberton School. It aims to teach about inheritance in Python, exploring how classes can inherit methods and attributes from other classes. This project is implemented by Guillaume and will cover various aspects of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), particularly focusing on inheritance.

## Project Details

**Author:** Guillaume  
**Weight:** 1  
**Start Date:** Feb 5, 2024, 6:00 AM  
**End Date:** Feb 6, 2024, 6:00 AM  
**Checker Release:** Feb 5, 2024, 12:00 PM  
**Auto Review Deadline:** Feb 6, 2024, 6:00 AM  

## Resources

Participants are advised to read or watch the following resources to better understand and complete the project:

- [Inheritance](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#inheritance)
- [Multiple inheritance](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#multiple-inheritance)
- [Inheritance in Python](https://realpython.com/inheritance-composition-python/)
- [Learn to Program 10 : Inheritance Magic Methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8kCdLCi6Lk)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, participants are expected to explain, without the help of Google, the following concepts:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What is a superclass, baseclass, or parentclass
- What is a subclass
- How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
- When can an instance have new attributes
- How to inherit a class from another
- How to define a class with multiple base classes
- What is the default class every class inherits from
- How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
- Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
- What is the purpose of inheritance
- What are, when, and how to use `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type`, and `super` built-in functions

## Project Requirements

- Ensure all your files interpret/compile correctly.
- Stick to the coding style guide [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
- All files must be executable.
- Write a detailed README that introduces the project, outlines the learning objectives, and describes the requirements.

## Contributions

While contributions are welcome, participants are reminded that the purpose of this project is educational, and as such, they are encouraged to understand and implement solutions individually.

## License
