# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

This project is part of the curriculum of Holberton School. The objective is to understand the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. By the end of this project, students should be able to explain the fundamental concepts of OOP without referring to external resources.

## Project Details

- **Instructor:** Guillaume
- **Weight:** 1
- **Start Date:** January 23, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **End Date:** January 24, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** January 23, 2024, 12:00 PM
- **Auto Review Deadline:** January 24, 2024, 6:00 AM

## Background Context

OOP is a new concept for many students, and it's crucial to grasp the fundamental concepts by reading, typing, testing, and understanding all the examples and resources provided. The main goal of this project is to experiment with OOP and play with it to understand its workings.

## Resources

Students should read or watch the following resources in the order presented:

1. **Object Oriented Programming** (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” excluded. You do NOT have to learn about class attributes, classmethod, and staticmethod yet).
2. **Object-Oriented Programming** (Be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows the way you should not use or write a class to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Read the specified paragraphs carefully).
3. **Properties vs. Getters and Setters**
4. **Learn to Program 9: Object Oriented Programming**
5. **Python Classes and Objects**
6. **Object Oriented Programming**

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

### General
- Why Python programming is awesome.
- What is OOP.
- “first-class everything”.
- What is a class.
- What is an object and an instance.
- The difference between a class and an object or instance.
- What is an attribute.
- How to use public, protected, and private attributes.
- What is self.
- What is a method.
- The special __init__ method and how to use it.
- What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding.
- What is a property.
- The difference between an attribute and a property in Python.
- The Pythonic way to write getters and setters.
- How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class.
- How to bind attributes to objects and classes.
- What is the __dict__ of a class and/or instance of a class and what does it contain.
- How Python finds the attributes of an object or class.
- How to use the getattr function.
