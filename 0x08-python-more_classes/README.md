# 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

This project is part of the curriculum of Holberton School. The project aims to deepen understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. Throughout this project, we will explore advanced concepts of classes and objects, delve into the nuances of class methods, static methods, data abstraction, data encapsulation, and much more.
